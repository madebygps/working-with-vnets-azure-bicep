# Building and working with virtual networks in Azure 

As cloud computing becomes increasingly popular, you might think skills like networking and security are no longer needed. And whilst the cloud can automate many of these services, they are still required for custom solutions and experimentation. , In this three part series, Gwyn and Liam will break down how to deploy a virtual network to Azure with an infrastructure as code tool called Bicep, how to work within it, and how to secure it with security groups, access control lists (ACL), IAM (Identity & Access Management) (Identity & Access Management) policies, and more. If you are looking to improve your Bicep, networking, security, and Azure infrastructure skills, this series is for you.
